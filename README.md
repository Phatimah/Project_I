## First Project: Investigate a Relational Database
*20/10/2022*

In this project, I used SQL to investigate a database relating to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to execute SQL queries and provided helpful database-related information. I created visualizations to display the results of my SQL queries after running the queries.

The student's presentation should consist of four slides, each of which should include (a) an interesting question, (b) a SQL query to help answer that question, (c) a visualization built from the results of those SQL queries, and (d) a brief summary.

## Second Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data
*12/12/2022*

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Third Project: Version Control
*30/01/2023*

This task included refactoring Project 2 using Git and GitHub in a simulated process. 

Project submission included filling out a template with all the Git commands necessary to complete the tasks.
